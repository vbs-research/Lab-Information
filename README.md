# VBS Lab Vision
Our research explores how artificial intelligence and machine learning can drive discovery and impact across multiple disciplines. We specialize in developing and applying AI methods (such as classical machine learning, time-series analysis, generative models and explainable ML) to problems in finance, healthcare and other core industries. By partnering with domain experts, we aim to unlock discoveries and create tools with impact in both science and practice.

Equally important is the commitment to student engagement and outcomes. I select and design projects so that masterâ€™s students at all levels can contribute meaningfully while building critical research skills. Students may start by replicating published studies, grow into applied model development, and eventually take on leadership roles in writing and collaboration. Through this work, they gain not only technical expertise but also the experience of co-authoring publications and advancing interdisciplinary research. Thus, my vision is two-fold: to enable AI-driven innovation and to prepare the next generation of applied AI leaders.

# VBS Lab Research Focus

The primary focus of my research changes across time, largely driven by personal interests (the beauty of not being beholden to the grant-writing machine!) as well as opportunities to construct meaningful research projects for students. I enjoy partnering on a wide range of topics, so if you already have an idea and are looking for a mentor, collaborator or just someone to bounce ideas off, please reach out!

My current work focuses on the application of artificial intelligence to the financial sector. More specifically, I aim to answer key questions surrounding equities (stocks) and understanding both their behavior and future performance. Within this space I am pursuing three tracks:

1)	Financial forecast datasets 
Today, there are no widely accepted multi-modal benchmarks in the financial field for academics to evaluate novel forecasting algorithms. Perhaps even more pressing is the lack of high-quality, easily accessible datasets to facilitate development of these algorithms. We aim to fill this gap by providing curated & refreshed datasets that include descriptions of price, sentiment, technical signals, public events and other key factors. Additionally, we want to drive adoption of nascent (but promising) benchmarks such as FinTSB through direct integration with our datasets.

2)	Financial forecasting
Recent advancements in deep learning (transformers & Large-Language Models) and Natural Language Processing have emerged as promising candidates for both forecasting and understanding equity price movement. We aim to harness these advances both for the prediction of future stock market value as well as create a richer understanding of what truly drives equity prices. 

3)	Applied financial strategies
Financial portfolio principles such as asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing are just as (if not more important than) the underlying selection of equities in terms of overarching performance. We aim to better understand how these strategies behave across a range of different conditions, and how advances in artificial intelligence can unlock new insights into these timeless principles, while proposing new directions for the portfolio manager.
